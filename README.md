# City Hall
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production chooser
reorganized the production list to improve readability and to show more
items.  building yields now appear directly next to the *ageless* icon.

## better population visibility
added color to the city & town interface:

- green hexes for rural improvements
- blue hexes for urban districts
- a purple hex for the city center

## unique building guides
highlighted unique districts in the building placement lens.  all
districts with a unique building appear in Culture purple, to help you
find them again when placing the second building (and to help you avoid
placing non-unique buildings there by mistake).
