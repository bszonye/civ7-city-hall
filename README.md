# City Hall 1.3.0
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production list and city details
new and improved features:

- compact redesign for the production list and building breakdown
- yellow highlighting for damaged buildings so you don't miss repairs
- better sorting for improvements, wonders, and walls
- simpler icons for agelesss buildings and maintenance costs
- a new Overview tab showing demographics and connected settlements

## better population visibility
colorful settlement tiles including:

- green hexes for rural improvements
- blue hexes for urban districts
- a purple hex for the city center

## unique quarter assistant
guides unique building construction in the building interface, with
orange hexes to warn you before blocking a unique quarter by:

- placing unique buildings on different tiles
- completing a non-unique quarter with a unique building
- adding a non-unique building to a unique district

the interface now recognizes unique buildings in progress and in the
production queue, to help you plan both buildings at the same time.

## bug fixes
fixed base game bugs so that adjacency arrows appear reliably and
repairs clear from the production list when you build them.

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: compatible.**  No conflicts.
- **MantisMaestro's Compact Production Chooser: compatible.**  when both
  mods are installed, MM's production list replaces the City Hall
  version.
- **KayleeR's Misc UI Modifications: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, City Hall features replace some parts of KayleeR's mod
  related to the production list and building placement.

## localization
