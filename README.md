# City Hall 1.2.0
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production chooser
reorganizes the production list to improve readability and to show more
items.  building yields now appear directly next to the *ageless* icon.

## better population visibility
adds color to the city & town interface:

- green hexes for rural improvements
- blue hexes for urban districts
- a purple hex for the city center

## unique quarter helper
guides unique quarter construction in the building interface.  orange
hexes indicate any tile placement that would block a unique quarter,
including:

- placing unique buildings on different tiles
- completing a non-unique quarter with a unique building
- adding a non-unique building to a unique district

the interface now recognizes unique buildings in progress and in the
production queue, to help you plan both buildings at the same time.

## more city details
adds an Overview tab to the City Details panel, showing population
demographics and connected settlements.  also reorganizes the Building
Breakdown tab for readability and compactness, like the production
chooser.

## bug fixes
adjacency arrows now appear every time you place a building.  previously
they would only appear the very first time.

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: compatible.**  No conflicts.
- **MantisMaestro's Compact Production Chooser: compatible.**  when both
  mods are installed, MM's production list replaces the City Hall
  version.
- **KayleeR's Misc UI Modifications: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, the unique quarter assistant in City Hall replaces the
  similar feature in KayleeR's mod.
